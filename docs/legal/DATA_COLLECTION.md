# Data Collection & Telemetry (Draft)

Default telemetry is minimal and configurable.

Collected:
- action audit logs (what/when/approved by whom)
- crash/error logs (for stability)

Not collected by default:
- keystrokes
- screen recording
- microphone recording
- unrelated file contents

All telemetry settings must be visible and user-controlled.
